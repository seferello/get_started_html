      <p>My name is Sam. I am a young professional, activist, and traveler working towards my next big move.<br>

        The next few years will bring many changes as I move to Spain for my Master's in Corporate Communication, travel Europe,
        and work abroad.

    <h2>Quote</h2>
    <p>
      “To my mind, the greatest reward and luxury of travel is to be able to experience everyday<br> 
      things as if for the first time, to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted.”<br>
      <it>from Bill Bryson</it>
